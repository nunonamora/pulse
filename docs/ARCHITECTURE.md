# Architecture

Pulse is a local, layered macOS application.

## Components

- `PulseApp` owns the SwiftUI lifecycle, notch panel, settings, and Codex observation timer.
- `Pulse` is the command-line entry point used by installation, hooks, notifications, and diagnostics.
- `PulseCore` contains domain models, persistence, integration parsers, process discovery, focus planning, and installation.

## Data flow

Claude hooks, the OpenCode and Pi integrations, the Codex watcher, the Convoy runs watcher, and the process reaper normalize lifecycle information into versioned `AgentSession` documents. `StateRepository` atomically publishes those documents under `~/.pulse/state`. Convoy phase ownership is applied as a repository projection so its internal OpenCode documents never become global rows, even if their producer rewrites them. `StateStore` observes the directory and exposes active sessions to the notch UI. Selecting a session reloads its latest process and terminal enrichment before creating a constrained focus action for tmux or a supported terminal.

## Presentation

The bar adapts to the selected screen (`NotchLayout.Presentation`). A display with a camera housing — `safeAreaInsets.top > 0` with auxiliary top areas present — keeps the status summary around the physical notch; every other display gets a virtual notch centred within its menu-bar strip. Both use the same concave upper-shoulder and rounded lower-corner radii (`HangingNotchMetrics`); expansion preserves those arcs and adds straight vertical sides between them. A physical notch uses side-aware widths, with 12 pt toward the camera, 8 pt at the glyph's left edge, and 14 pt reserved by the right counter for the shoulder radius; virtual pills retain 18 pt horizontal padding. The collapsed summary is provider-agnostic and reports only the running, waiting, and blocked counts that are nonzero right now — same-size dots for waiting/idle (green) and blocked (red), and a spinner for running. Expanding grows an 800 pt silhouette around a centred 784 pt detail surface with 8 pt shell and card insets, while every session retains room for provider, terminal title, project, Git branch or Convoy step, and elapsed time; both presentations share that single collapsed↔expanded spring. `ScreenSelection` chooses a stable display identity from the pointer by default, with Settings options to prefer the focused window or show independent panels on all connected displays. Focused-window mode filters the front-to-back Quartz window list to the frontmost external PID and normal on-screen windows, then chooses the display with the greatest bounds intersection; exact ties use the stable display ID. It reads no names or window content and requests no privacy privileges. Missing, restricted, invalid, or offscreen geometry falls back to the pointer, last selected display, then first connected display. The controller checks the selected policy while the pointer moves, after activation/Space/display changes, relocates immediately, and defers a single-display relocation until an open menu closes. A `PointerMovementGate` keeps hover-expansion locked until the pointer actually moves after a jump — the bar appearing under a stationary pointer is not a hover. The panel only accepts mouse events inside the visible silhouette, so the rest of the menu bar remains clickable.

## Trust boundaries

Hook payloads, JSONL rollouts, process output, state files, terminal metadata, and existing user configuration are untrusted. Readers bound input sizes and ignore symbolic links. State files use collision-free encoded names and private permissions. Process execution uses argument arrays and trusted executable locations; no runtime value is evaluated by a shell.

## Integrations

| Tool | Primary signal | Fallback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | lifecycle hooks | process scanner |
| OpenCode | local plugin events | process scanner |
| Pi | local extension events | process scanner |
| Codex CLI | rollout JSONL + notify | process scanner |
| Convoy | run metadata | process scanner |

The reaper removes dead sessions and creates fallback state for detectable processes. It also verifies native documents that have been quiet for a full five-second observation interval against the detected agent set, but requires two consecutive misses before removing an otherwise live PID. Process identity combines PID with kernel start time, so PID reuse and zombies cannot preserve old state. Daemon-hosted sessions are rebound globally one-to-one by terminal identity when available, then by an unambiguous same-tool working-directory match. Basic libproc reconciliation runs before optional, time-bounded Ghostty enrichment. Convoy metadata changes are watched directly; a verified run keeps a one-heartbeat final-state grace after its process exits. Every removal posts the Darwin state-change notification as well as changing the directory, so the UI refreshes without waiting for its polling fallback.

## State schema

Schema version 1 records tool, session ID, PID, lifecycle status, project path, timestamps, terminal context, and optional source. Pulse may add an optional `process_identity` containing that PID and its kernel start time in microseconds; older integration documents remain valid and are enriched during reconciliation. Unsupported schema versions fail closed.

Integration-owned lifecycle documents remain the authority for status, attention reason, step, and activity timestamps. Reconciliation never replaces those documents to add process or Ghostty metadata. App-owned enrichment is stored separately as `enrichment-<tool>-<base64url-session-id>.overlay`, using internal overlay schema version 1. The bounded overlay contains only its lifecycle binding (PID, optional identity, and start time), one verified target process identity, and optional terminal metadata. Overlay files are atomically replaced with mode `0600`; reads require a private owner-controlled regular file and reject links, oversized data, unknown schemas, changed lifecycle bindings, and recycled process generations. Invalid and orphaned overlays are ignored and pruned, and removing a lifecycle session removes its overlay. Loads merge a valid overlay in memory, leaving concurrent integration lifecycle writes untouched.

Convoy's durable OpenCode phase ownership is stored separately as `convoy-opencode-ownership.index`, using internal ownership schema version 1. The index is an exact, monotonic set of OpenCode session IDs collected from securely read `~/.convoy/runs/*/metadata.json` files; it contains no prompts or responses. It is atomically replaced with mode `0600`, bounded by entry count and file size, and read with the same owner, regular-file, no-follow, and stable-fingerprint checks as enrichment. A corrupt owner-controlled regular index is rebuilt only after a complete metadata inventory; transient I/O, unsafe metadata, links, FIFOs, and incomplete runs fail closed. Potentially live or not-yet-published run directories are watched before the startup baseline, with a fixed 64-watcher bound and the heartbeat as backstop. Repository snapshots retain the producer lifecycle document but omit indexed IDs from effective sessions, so plugin rewrites cannot race an internal phase back into the UI. This sidecar does not change `AgentSession` schema version 1.
