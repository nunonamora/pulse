# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve Atalaia.

## Development setup

Requirements:

- macOS 14 or newer;
- Swift 6.0 or newer;
- Node.js 20 or newer for OpenCode integration tests;
- Ghostty 1.3+, iTerm2, or Terminal for manual focus testing.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ixjosemi/Atalaia.git
cd Atalaia
swift build
swift run atalaia-tests
./scripts/build-app.sh
open .build/Atalaia.app
```

## Workflow

1. Open an issue for significant behavioral or architectural changes.
2. Add a failing behavioral test.
3. Implement the smallest complete change.
4. Run the full build and test commands.
5. Update documentation when behavior, permissions, privacy, or integrations change.

Use Conventional Commits, for example `fix(installer): reject symlinked config paths`. Keep pull requests focused and explain security/privacy implications.
